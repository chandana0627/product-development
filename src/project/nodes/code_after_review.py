        regenerate_prompt = f"""
        You are a **highly skilled senior software engineer** responsible for **regenerating code** after a critical review.  
        Your task is to **fix the identified issues** while keeping all previously correct parts intact.
        ---  
        ## **üîπ Issues Identified (Fix These)**
        The previous code was **rejected** due to the following issues:  
        {state['code_feedback']}
        **Carefully analyze each issue and ensure all problems are fixed.**  
        Use the following to guide your updates:  
        The following is the previously generated code.  
        ‚úÖ **Keep all correct parts unchanged** and **apply fixes only where necessary**.
        ```python
        {generated_code}
        ```
        ---  
        ## **üîπ Code Regeneration Guidelines**
        - **Modify only the problematic sections** while preserving correct functionality.  
        - Follow the **approved design** and fix **all** rejected issues.  
        - Ensure the code is **modular, structured, and scalable**. 
        - Make sure you have given the correct dependencies.
        - Follow **best coding practices (PEP8, SOLID, DRY)**.  
        - **DO NOT introduce unnecessary placeholder code.**  
        - **DO NOT** rewrite the entire code unless absolutely necessary.
        ---  
        ## **üõ† Example Output Format**  
        Your response **must strictly follow this format**:  
        ```plaintext
        ```src/api/routes.py
        <code for routes.py>
        ```src/models/user.py
        <code for user.py>
        ```
        ```src/database/connection.py
        <code for database connection>
        ```
        ```requirements.txt
        <dependencies list>
        ```
        the above provided example is to understand the format of the response that is expected please don't follow as it is according to the use case you have to generate it accordingly.        ```
        ---  
        **‚ö†Ô∏è STRICT INSTRUCTIONS:**  
        - **DO NOT** rewrite the entire code unless absolutely necessary.  
        - **DO NOT** include explanations, reasoning, or placeholders.  
        - Ensure **ALL** rejected issues are fixed before submitting.

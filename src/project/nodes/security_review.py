        ## üîç Security Review Guidelines

        ### 1. Essential Security (Must Check)
        - Authentication implementation (if user auth is required)
        - Password handling and storage
        - Basic input validation
        - Protection of sensitive data
        - API endpoint security

        ### 2. Data Protection
        - Data encryption (where necessary)
        - Secure storage of credentials
        - Safe handling of user data
        - Database security

        ### 3. Application Security
        - Input sanitization
        - Error handling
        - Session management
        - Access control

        ### 4. Infrastructure & Deployment
        - Environment configuration
        - Dependency management
        - Basic logging setup
        - Deployment security

        Note: Focus on security measures that are:
        - Critical for the specific use case
        - Proportional to the application's risk level
        - Required by the project requirements

        ## üö¶ Response Format

        For code that meets essential security requirements:
        ```plaintext
        APPROVED
        ```

        For code with security issues:
        ```plaintext
        REJECTED
        1. Issue 1: <Clear security vulnerability description>
        2. Issue 2: <Clear security vulnerability description>
        ...
        ```

        Only reject for:
        - Critical security flaws
        - Missing essential security features
        - Clear vulnerabilities
        - Non-compliance with basic security practices

        Note: Focus on practical security measures rather than theoretical perfection.
